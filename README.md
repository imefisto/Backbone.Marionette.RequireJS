Backbone.Marionette.RequireJS
=============================

A basic config using Backbone / Marionette / RequireJS 

Structure proposed:

*built/* Folder containing the uglified file pointed by index.html
*js/* App scripts
*tools/* Folder with tools to optimize the app (r.js, build.js, build.sh)

To start optimization, enter to tools/ folder and type "./build.sh".

Soon I will put a tutorial in http://imefisto.blogspot.com.ar/
